    <div><b>COVID-19 to Plunge Global Economy into Worst Recession since World War II</b></div>
    <p>NEW DELHI, July 22, 2020 - The swift and massive shock of the coronavirus pandemic
        and shutdown measures to contain it have plunged the global economy into a severe
        contraction. According to World Bank forecasts, the global economy will shrink by
        5.2% this year. That would represent the deepest recession since the Second World
        War, with the largest fraction of economies experiencing declines in per capita
        output since 1870, the World Bank says in its June 2020 Global Economic Prospects.</p>
    <p>Economic activity among advanced economies is anticipated to shrink 7% in 2020 as
        domestic demand and supply, trade, and finance have been severely disrupted.
        Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) are expected to shrink by 2.5%
        this year, their first contraction as a group in at least sixty years.
        Per capita incomes are expected to decline by 3.6%, which will tip millions
        of people into extreme poverty this year.</p>
    <p>The blow is hitting hardest in countries where the pandemic has been the most
        severe and where there is heavy reliance on global trade, tourism, commodity
        exports, and external financing. While the magnitude of disruption will vary
        from region to region, all EMDEs have vulnerabilities that are magnified by
        external shocks. Moreover, interruptions in schooling and primary health care
        access are likely to have lasting impacts on human capital development.</p>
    <p>“This is a deeply sobering outlook, with the crisis likely to leave long-lasting 
        scars and pose major global challenges,” said World Bank Group Vice President for
        Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions, Ceyla Pazarbasioglu. “Our first order 
        of business is to address the global health and economic emergency. Beyond that, 
        the global community must unite to find ways to rebuild as robust a recovery 
        as possible to prevent more people from falling into poverty and unemployment.”</p>

    <p>Under the baseline forecast—which assumes that the pandemic recedes sufficiently 
        to allow the lifting of domestic mitigation measures by mid-year in advanced 
        economies and a bit later in EMDEs, that adverse global spillovers ease during 
        the second half of the year and that dislocations in financial markets are not
        long-lasting — global growth is forecast to rebound to 4.2% in 2021, as advanced
        economies grow 3.9% and EMDEs bounce back by 4.6%.
        However, the outlook is highly uncertain and downside risks are predominant, including
        the possibility of a more protracted pandemic, financial upheaval, and retreat from 
        global trade and supply linkages. A downside scenario could lead the global 
        economy to shrink by as much as 8% this year, followed by a sluggish recovery
        in 2021 of just over 1%,  with output in EMDEs contracting by almost 5% 
        this year.</p>

    <h2 id ="news2"><u>Death rates pile up</u></h2>
    <div><b>Covid-19 Death rates continue pile up all over the world.</b></div>
    <p>NEW DELHI, July 22, 2020 - Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those
        who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 
        6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days. As of 22 July 2020, approximately 616,000 
        deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June, about 80 percent 
        of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing 
        health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p>
    <p> The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020. The first death outside 
        of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside 
        Asia was in France on 14 February.</p>
    <p>Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing
        positive according to protocols. This may ignore the deaths of people who die 
        without having been tested. Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying 
        conditions may lead to overcounting. Comparison of statistics for deaths for all
        causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.
        In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average.
        In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice 
        as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent
        higher than normal. This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained
        health care systems and bans on elective surgery.</p>

    <h2 id ="news3"><u>The New Normal</u></h2>
    <div><b>The New Normal after pandamic is Isolation.</b></div><br>
    <q> I have honestly not stepped outside my house for three months, in the truest sense.
        I get my groceries and medical supplies delivered and get my dose of vitamin D from 
        the balcony. I wasn’t exactly antisocial before the pandemic, but my social 
        batteries did run out a lot quicker than others. I haven’t attended any birthday party 
        or wedding celebrations (and no quick visit to the mall or the movies) in the past
        3 months and I feel that I am not capable of human interactions anymore. 
        I am worried but also strangely relieved that I don’t have to dress up and make efforts
        to hold conversations anymore. It is scary, but I simply don’t want to go back 
        to pre-pandemic social routine.- Neha Anand, 32 (name changed to protect privacy)</q>
    <p> Whether the above-mentioned statement evokes a sense of empathy or confusion in you, 
        we can all agree to the fact that the pandemic has changed the way we used to interact
        with the world around us, in more ways than one. With social distancing and
        quarantining being the new norms of survival during the infectious contagion,
        people across the globe are staying cooped up inside their homes, as much as 
        possible.</p>
    <p> We are terrified with the mere sight of another human in our vicinity, let alone 
        murmuring a ‘bless you’ when someone sneezes or coughs. 
        We don face masks and face shields as our  armours in the battle. We carry
        hand sanitizers and aerosol disinfectants  like our weapons ---ready to spritz 
       and spray the invisible enemy away. A couple of months ago, we were almost 
       enthusiastic and hopeful of the time when things would go back to 
        “normal” that we were so used to. 7 months down the road, almost everyone is confined 
        within the walls of their home and sharing throwback memories on Instagram.</p>
    <p> We, humans, are adaptable beings, and hence, just like that, we have adapted to 
       spending less than a fraction of time outside of homes. We are binge-watching and
       guilt-tripping all at once. We are getting increasingly comfortable with the idea of
       spending our whole day inside our homes, to the point where it may get scary.</p>
    <p> It is scary because when the day finally comes when the restrictions are lifted, 
        the malls have the season-end sale, the theatres start featuring the latest release
        and the swings in children parks become functional again-- we may not want to step 
        outside anymore. While staying alone, may give you a greater perspective of your own
        emotions and may even reduce the need for constant validation, it also strips us from 
        one of the very essence of what makes us human-- social interactions.</p>
    <p> Additionally, extended amount of isolation can also trigger feelings of anxiety and 
        depressive episodes in those with vulnerable mental health. This is precisely why 
        we need human connections and find novel methods of connecting with our circle 
        or group, especially during these testing times.</p>
    <p> While physical distance continues to be a regular norm for an unforeseen future, one
        can always make use of social media platforms, voice calling and video calling to 
        tackle loneliness. Even if you have started to feel incredibly comfortable in 
        your cocoon, you may have to remind yourself that you always
        need your tribe with you, more so if you are living alone during a pandemic.</p>
    <p> While technology may not be able to recreate the warmth of a hug or the 
        anti-depressant like impact of coffee dates with your best friends, 
        it is certainly the next best thing right now. 
        So, take the first step and just drop a little hi to people you care for, 
        but haven’t spoken to in a month or so. Nobody is asking you to take part in
        Zoom  call meet-ups with extended family members right away, but setting aside some 
        time to speak to those you are closest to should be the goal. Ultimately, we are 
       all in this together and we will come out of this together.</p>
    <b> Remember, we are already battling a pandemic, let’s not create another 
        one out of loneliness.</b>
